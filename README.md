# fpga-orderbook-analysis
NYU FRE Capstone project implementing a low-latency system for detecting market patterns using LSTM networks deployed on FPGA hardware. Combines deep learning with hardware acceleration to analyze high-frequency order book data in microseconds.

# Real-Time Order Book Analysis with LSTM on FPGA

This capstone project explores the use of deep learning and hardware acceleration for real-time financial market analysis. The system uses an LSTM neural network deployed on an FPGA to detect behavioral patterns in high-frequency limit order book (LOB) data with microsecond-level latency.

Developed for the Financial and Risk Engineering Capstone at NYU Tandon.
