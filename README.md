# fpga-orderbook-analysis

NYU FRE Capstone project implementing a low-latency system for detecting market patterns using LSTM networks deployed on FPGA hardware. Combines deep learning with hardware acceleration to analyze high-frequency order book data in microseconds.

## 🧠 Real-Time Order Book Analysis with LSTM on FPGA

This capstone project explores the integration of deep learning and reconfigurable hardware for ultra-low-latency financial signal detection. It leverages an LSTM-based neural network to analyze synthetic limit order book (LOB) data and flags directional movements, spoofing, and liquidity shifts. The trained model is optimized and deployed onto FPGA using the FINN compiler and Xilinx toolchain.

Developed for the Financial and Risk Engineering Capstone at NYU Tandon.
