 * Author: Xhovani Mali
 * File: FeatureExtraction.h
 *
 * Description:
 * This module defines the OrderbookFeature structure and the FeatureExtractor class,
 * which are responsible for transforming raw order book snapshots into structured,
 * model-friendly features for deep learning applications.
 *
 * The FeatureExtractor computes price and spread trends, size imbalance, VWMP differences,
 * normalized bid/ask levels, and temporal statistics such as momentum and volatility.
 * It also provides methods to prepare labeled time-series sequences based on future
 * mid-price movement â€” essential for supervised training of LSTM-based predictors.
 *
 * These features are saved in binary format for use in model training and hardware deployment.
